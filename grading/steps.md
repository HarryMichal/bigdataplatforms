# Grading

An overall sheet of student id, basic information of datasets and technologies and the assignment file is given, e.g.:


|studentid|infrastructures|programming languages|data|messaging systems|databases|evaluators|
---|----|----|----|----|-----|---|
|1234   |container   | Python   |NY Taxi|Kafka  | Cassandra  | ABC  |

1. claim an open assignment by putting your name into "evaluators" in the overall sheet.
2. download a zipfile to the machine used to evaluate the assignment
2. unzip the file
3. copy the template assignment[1,2,3]-grade-studentid.md into the assignment directory and modify the student id
    -the student id can bee seen in the zip file: "assignment[1,2,3]-studentid"
    -if we cannot see the studentid, then pls. check the source of the zipfile to see studentid in submitter.csv
    -if not, then pls assign a number and keep the name of the zip file clearly so we can trace
4. grade and update the assignment[1,2,3]-grade-studentid.md
   - follow the protocol of grading for individual assignment (within a grading team and cross grading teams)
   - check also selfgrading.csv to see selfgrading from students
   - some students do not do selfgrade (or just put a random grade)
5. Upload the assignment[1,2,3]-grade-studentid.md to the "done" directory
   - keep sources in your computer for final check, we will delete only after the final grade submitted.
6. Update the overall sheet with basic information of datasets and technologies


The cross-check can be done immediately or later, depending on the situation.

After all assignments have been graded in the first round. The cross-check will be performed.

> In the cross check phase, the new/revised grade will be stored in a new directory, e.g., *new-done*, *new-new-done*. Previous grade reports will never be changed, only copy the previous report and modify the copied version.
