# How does LLM support the study of big data platforms

Using LLM (Large Language Model) services is very common for the study and development of software and systems. In this trend, we examine and practice some situations when LLM could help to assist your study in this course.
>TODO: to be developed. 

## Some questions to ask LLMs

### Generic situations 
>Q: "are you familiar with big data platforms?"

then look at the list of technologies/platforms it returns, see if the course also covers the mentioned key technologies and platforms. If not, let us discuss the reasons. 
>Q: "Oh I know [xyz] but what are [abc]"? for example: xyz=HBase and abc="data lakes"?

then let us see. what is the response? if you have some doubts then ask something like 
>Q: "it sounds like a [abc] or a [xyz]. what is the difference?", e.g., abc="database" and xyz="data service"

Sometimes you dont know any databases for studying the first assignment. Then you can ask LLMs:

>Q: "I dont know any NoSQL database, which one should I start for my study of big data platforms?" 

Then see what are the suggestions. 

Probably, the above-mentioned questions are simple so you can start to fire some questions strongly related to your scenario.

>Q: "Ok. I want to find the big dataset to use to test big data ingestion and your suggested NoSQL, can you recommend some datasets?"

but it may return some high level information. Then you can ask some specific things like: 

>Q: "Concretely, I meant the dataset with the links that i can download for IoT scenarios, for example"
