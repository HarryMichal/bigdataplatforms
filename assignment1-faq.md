## Can I use Go Programming Language for Assignment 1

>In principle Go is a relevant programming language for cloud and big data. However, as we explained at the beginning of the course that we cannot handle the situation when everyone can bring a programming language of his/her own choice, e.g., C++ and Rust, which are out of the predefined list.

We have made [a survey](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/mod/questionnaire/view.php?id=491474) and only 3 people voted for Go for Assignment 1. Consider that a very small number of students (3) wanted to use Go, the students (3) voted for Go can use it and only the voters (3) have to use Go.

## I have selected Technology A (e.g., MongoDB or Cassandra) for **mysimbdp-coredms**, but I dont know   which technologies I have to choose for **mysimbdp-daas** and **mysimbdp-dataingest**!

In fact, it is you who must  select the technologies, as a designer of **mysimbdp**. You know the data you have to support and you select the technology for **mysimbdp-coredms** and you know which programming languages are the best for you to implement. Thus you need to decide how design and develop **mysimbdp-dataingest** and **mysimbdp-daas** based on the above-mentioned choices and requirements.

In fact, in course, we do not teach which technologies in this case but we explain different possiblities. For example, the example of **BigQuery** in [slide nr. 5 of the lecture Service and Integration Models in Big Data Platforms](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/pluginfile.php/1068496/mod_page/content/5/module1-lecture3-0-integrationbdp-v0.1.pdf)  shows that a service could offer REST and client libraries in different languages for clients. You can see that similar programming supports are available for the technology selected for **mysimbdp-coredms** (e.g., APIs and client libraries in different programming languages for MongoDB or Cassandra)
