# Assignment 2 FAQ

## Can I use Nifi to move files?

Yes you can use Nifi to move files. But pls. read the assignment carefully because there is a part that the customer provides a specific program for ingesting the customer data into the final destination. This requires the integration of the customer ingestion program with any pipeline that you design using Nifi. Check again our discussion in the lecture and tutorial about connecting ingestion pipelines.
